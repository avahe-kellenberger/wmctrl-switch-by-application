## About

This script is a derivitive of code found somewhere on the internet (forgot where) that was not working for me,
so I have altered it to do so.

This script is intended to be used as a key binding; I've personally set it up using the ``alt+` `` keybinding.
It currently only cycles forward through the windows, but if anyone is interested I'll add more functionality.
